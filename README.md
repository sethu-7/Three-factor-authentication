This project focuses on developing a lightweight, three-factor authentication protocol tailored for
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in agricultural fields. The paper talks about a secure system
in agricultural field consisting of a gateway network(GWN) multiple sensory devices(SDj) and
user(Ui). The paper explains the methodology which explains the protocol which includes
initialization, pre-deployment, user registration and key agreement. In this the GWN acts as a
trusted third party which is responsible for user and sensor registration. The user and sensor
devices are authorized by the GWN to finally generate a shared secret key for communication
between the user and sensor device. By using cryptographic techniques and implementing
mutual authentication processes, the proposed protocol addresses key vulnerabilities such as
ephemeral secret leakage attacks, user anonymity, and perfect forward secrecy.
